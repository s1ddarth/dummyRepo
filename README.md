Hey guys,

Everything you need should be in the MyLife folder.

As of now, I made everyone a HTML template to work on your portion of the project. So far, I have made a simple login page and I already connected everything by making a navigation bar that links to each portion of the our project. You should see the navbar code in each of your templates.

# If you wish to test the user interface.. 
Download the zip file and open up "index.html" in your web browser. There is no form validation implemented yet for the login, so you don't have to enter in a user and password. Just click login.

# As far as how to work on your part.. 
If you look into the "views" folder there's an HTML file for every part of the project. So whatever your portion of the project is, edit that HTML file.

The folders labeled "js", "css", "assets", and "images" are there for organzation. You can create any javascript and/or css file and put them into their respective folders.

# If you do create a css and/or javascript file.. 
Make sure you link them in between the "head" html element portion of the HTML. Refer to messaging.html as an example of how to link javascript and css files.


# NOTE:
I imported jQuery and Bootstrap into our project. I'll leave links to their documentation on how to use them below.
I used Bootstrap because they have an ample amount of classes written to style our HTML and jQuery to make DOM manipulation syntatically easier.

Also, any changes you make to the navigation bar won't be reflected on other peoples' pages because they're all copy pasted into every template. I've been trying to figure out how to share headers across every web page, but I keep getting this stupid "cross-origin" error. Any changes you make to the navbar you'll have to go to every page and implement those changes as well.
